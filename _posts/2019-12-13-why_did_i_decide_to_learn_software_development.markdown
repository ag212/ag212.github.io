Hey reader, my name is Abraham Galva some know me as Abe either one is okay with me.

I grew up in the 1990/2000's era in NYC (Florida for 11yrs and back to NY recently) and been around computers my entire 

life; my dad is a software/hardware vendor for Point of Sales Software/Maintenance for Stores/Markets. Safe to say i've 

witnessed and learn different type of systems growing up.

The start of Microsoft Windows and Apple Macintosh computers hitting the market to next 

Nintendo/SegaGenesis/Playstation gaming systems coming in as well as a few years later the introduction of cell-phone 

devices (Nextel & Sidekicks to name a few). Sidenote: Still a loyal gamer (playstation if curious). I always knew how to 

troubleshoot and fix minor issues and even virus/malware that affected my devices but always had a itch for developing 

software of all kinds I came accross with but lacked the background knowledge needed to do that so I got discouraged 

and did other endeavours in my life. 

From my mid-teens to mid 20's I was involved in a x amount of different industries from retail, sales, security, 

transportation, construction, hospitality industry, food & beverage, software/hardware support to name a few. 

You could say I was looking for my passion but I still felt a void and wondered what if I got into the I.T. field and learned 

how to create/develop idea. I feel I have a super creative mind that I can fix any issue I come across with, whether its 

physically or intellectually.

So I decided to dive in 100% into the field no matter the obstacle and thats how I came to find top-rated Bootcamp  

Flatiron School in New York. Got accepted into the school part-time and financial needs were met ðŸ™Œ.  Now in the 

process of learning and networking with other folks who are starting as i'am and experienced ones who I've had the 

pleasure to come across with and will in future endeavours...more to this story to come soon.
